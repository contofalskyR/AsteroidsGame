# AsteroidsGame
Just a placeholder

Potentially a Categorization epxeriment. Much to be modifed. 

Controls are more race car game like where movement controls are WASD and <- & -> are directions for the shooter. 

Things to modify for experiment: 
1. Core Gameplay Change
Replace shooting with categorization (A/D keys for Category A/B)
Remove destruction mechanics, add right/wrong feedback

2. Shape System
Replace asteroids with shapes (or something else)

3. Scoring & Feedback
Points & visual feedback for correct categorization (maybe: bonus for speed/difficulty)

4. Level Progression (potential)
Vary category overlap (Level 1: 99% separable â†’ Level 5: 90% separable)
Rotate informative dimensions between levels
Increase speed/complexity as player improves

5. Discrimination Testing (Mini-game between levels)
Show two shapes briefly, player indicates same/different
Measures perceptual improvement along different dimensions
Critical for demonstrating categorical perception effects
